# Polynomial
Uses linked lists to perform symbolic operations on polynomials. This project was a student assignment in Rutgers' CS112 course.
The driver and program framework were written by course instructors, while methods to manipulate polynomials in src/polynomial.class
were written by Daniel Ayoub. These methods include add, multiply, and evaluate.
